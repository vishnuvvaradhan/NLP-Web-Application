This web application handles user-inputted json text files (corpuses) for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
Utilized Anvil to develop a dynamic web app interface
Utilized libraries such as Spacy, Plotly Express, and transformers for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and summarization.
Integrated UMAP, HDBSCAN, CountVectorizer, and BERTopic for clustering and dimensionality reduction -- for Topic Modeling
